### Install
~~~sh
npm i -S graphql-auto-generating-cms

> **If CMS doesn't work correct or you have any error massages in console after bundling your project, instead of ```npm```, directly use source code from ```./src``` or ```./lib``` folder in repository, to import React component on client side.**

> **if you use React component from source code, you need to install following babel presets:**
* **babel-preset-es2015**
* **babel-preset-react**
* **babel-preset-stage-0**
* **babel-preset-stage-1**
